# Unhandled JSON Key Access and Generic Exception Handling in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications: accessing a JSON key that might not exist and handling exceptions generically. These issues can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code exhibiting these problems.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides improved error handling and safer key access.
